Configuring advanced HTTP client settings
-----------------------------------------

UNICORE client stack can be configured with several advanced options. In most cases
you can skip this section as defaults are fine. 

The following table lists all available options. A special note for the _http.*_ properties:
those are passed to the Apache Commons HTTP Client library. Therefore it is possible to configure
all relevant options of the client. The options are listed under this address:
 http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/preference-api.html Also see the example below.

[NOTE]
Various UNICORE modules use different property prefixes. Here we don't put any, but in practice you have
to use the prefix (see the reference table above for the actual prefix). Also properties might need to be provided
using different syntax, as XML.

Here we are setting an extremely short connection and socket timeouts for the clients
calls, using the Apache HTTP client parameters. Additionally server hostname to certificate subject 
name checking is set to cause connections failures, preventing man in the middle attacks. 

  client.http.connection.timeout=2000
  client.http.socket.timeout=2000
  client.serverHostnameChecking=FAIL
