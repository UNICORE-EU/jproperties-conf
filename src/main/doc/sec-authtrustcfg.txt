Configuring PKI trust settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) trust settings are used to validate certificates. This is performed, 
in the first place when a connection with a remote peer is initiated over the network, using the SSL (or TLS) protocol.
Additionally certificate validation can happen in few other situations, e.g. when checking digital signatures 
of various sensitive pieces of data.

Certificates validation is primarily configured using a set of initially trusted certificates of so called 
Certificate Authorities (CAs). Those trusted certificates are also known as _trust anchors_ and their collection
is called as a _trust store_.

Except of _trust anchors_ validation mechanism can use additional input for checking if a certificate being checked 
was not revoked and if its subject is in a permitted namesapce. 

UNICORE allows for different types of trust stores. All of them are configured using a set of properties.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

[NOTE]
Various UNICORE modules use different property prefixes. Here we don't put any, but in practice you have
to use the prefix (see the reference table above for the actual prefix). Also properties might need to be provided
using different syntax, as XML. However in all cases the properties to use and values are the same. 
 
Directory truststore, with complete set of options:

 truststore.type=directory
 truststore.allowProxy=DENY
 truststore.updateInterval=1234
 truststore.directoryLocations=/trust/dir/*.pem http://caserver/ca.pem
 truststore.directoryEncoding=PEM
 truststore.directoryConnectionTimeout=100
 truststore.directoryDiskCachePath=/tmp
 truststore.crlLocations=/trust/dir/*.crl http://caserver/crl.pem
 truststore.crlUpdateInterval=400
 truststore.crlMode=REQUIRE
 truststore.crlConnectionTimeout=200
 truststore.crlDiskCachePath=/tmp

Openssl truststore:

 truststore.type=openssl
 truststore.opensslPath=/truststores/openssl
 truststore.opensslNsMode=EUGRIDPMA_GLOBUS_REQUIRE
 truststore.allowProxy=ALLOW
 truststore.updateInterval=1234
 truststore.crlMode=IF_VALID

Java keystore used as a trust store:

 truststore.type=keystore
 truststore.keystorePath=src/test/resources/certs/truststore.jks
 truststore.keystoreFormat=JKS
 truststore.keystorePassword=xxxxxx


Configuring the credential
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UNICORE uses private key and a corresponding certificate (called together as a _credential_) 
to identify users and servers. Credentials might be provided in several formats. The following table list all possible 
variants and corresponding parameters.

Credential as a pair of DER files:

 credential.format=der
 credential.password=the\!njs
 credential.path=src/test/resources/credentials/cert-1.der
 credential.keyPath=src/test/resources/credentials/pk-1.der

Credential as a JKS file (type can be autodetected in almost every case):

 credential.path=src/test/resources/certs/server1.jks
 credential.password=xxxxxx
